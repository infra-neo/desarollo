# Backend Integration Implementation Plan

## Status: Phase 1 Started ✅

This document tracks the implementation of backend integrations for the multi-cloud hybrid platform.

## Phase 1: Cloud Connectors (Apache Libcloud Pattern) - IN PROGRESS

### Completed ✅
- Created `cloudManager.ts` with comprehensive cloud connector architecture
- Implemented GCP Connector with full lifecycle management:
  - Connect/disconnect
  - List regions, instance sizes, OS images
  - Create/start/stop/delete instances
  - Get instance status
- Implemented LXD Connector with container management:
  - LXD API integration patterns
  - Container lifecycle management
  - Profile-based resource allocation
- CloudManager orchestrator for multi-cloud operations

### API Endpoints Required (Backend Implementation Needed)
```
GET  /api/cloud/gcp/instances - List GCP instances
POST /api/cloud/gcp/instances - Create GCP instance
POST /api/cloud/gcp/instances/:id/start - Start instance
POST /api/cloud/gcp/instances/:id/stop - Stop instance
DELETE /api/cloud/gcp/instances/:id - Delete instance

GET  /api/cloud/lxd/containers - List LXD containers
POST /api/cloud/lxd/containers - Create container
PUT  /api/cloud/lxd/containers/:id/state - Change container state
DELETE /api/cloud/lxd/containers/:id - Delete container
GET  /api/cloud/lxd/images - List available images
```

### Next Steps for Phase 1
1. Need access to POC repository documents:
   - `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - For understanding existing architecture
   - `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - For cloud connector implementation details
2. Create backend API server (Express.js or similar)
3. Implement actual GCP and LXD API clients
4. Test connectivity and instance management

## Phase 2: Headscale + Remote Management - PENDING

### Requirements
- Headscale integration for node management
- Modify wizard flow for adding remote equipment
- Use commands generated by Headscale for node registration
- Remotely integration with domain: gate.kappa4.com
- Update download URLs for Remotely installer

### Needs from POC
- Headscale configuration and setup patterns
- Remote equipment registration flow details

## Phase 3: Authentik + LDAP + TSPlus - PENDING

### Requirements
- Authentik server configuration
- LDAP server setup (OpenLDAP)
- Corporate login flow:
  1. User enters email in "Cuenta Corporativa"
  2. Authentik queries LDAP for credentials
  3. Credentials passed to TSPlus via headers/cookies
  4. Automatic login to Windows session via HTML5

### Needs from POC
- `LDAP_AUTHENTIK_CONFIG.md` - LDAP and Authentik configuration details
- TSPlus integration patterns
- Session credential forwarding mechanism

## Phase 4: Remotely + Websoft9 Integration - PENDING

### Requirements
- Frontend integration with Remotely features:
  - Remote desktop via HTML5
  - File transfer
  - SSH access
  - Application installation
- Websoft9 integration for app catalog
- RAC (Remote Access Controller) for HTML5 connections

### Needs from POC
- Remotely API endpoints and authentication
- Websoft9 integration patterns
- RAC configuration for HTML5 remote desktop

## Phase 5: Dashboard Redesign - PLANNED

### Requirements
- Replace current /dashboard with multi-cloud overview
- Real-time status of entire environment
- User-specific resource summary
- Consider making /clouds the default dashboard
- Professional multi-cloud management interface

### Ideas
- Real-time cloud resource status cards
- Cost monitoring across providers
- Resource utilization graphs
- Quick actions for common tasks
- Activity feed
- Alerts and notifications

## Infrastructure Services Deployment

### Required Services
```yaml
services:
  # Authentication
  authentik:
    image: ghcr.io/goauthentik/authentik
    depends_on: [postgresql, redis]
  
  # Database
  postgresql:
    image: postgres:15
    
  # Cache
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    
  # LDAP
  openldap:
    image: osixia/openldap
    
  # Remote Access
  remotely:
    image: immense/remotely
    
  # App Platform
  websoft9:
    image: websoft9/websoft9
    
  # Guacamole (HTML5 Remote Desktop)
  guacamole:
    image: guacamole/guacamole
    depends_on: [guacd, postgres]
    
  guacd:
    image: guacamole/guacd
```

### Deployment Configuration Needed
- Docker Compose file for all services
- Environment variables configuration
- Network configuration
- Volume mounts for persistence
- Domain routing (gate.kappa4.com)

## Technical Debt
- Backend API server not yet created
- Database models for storing cloud connections
- Authentication middleware for API requests
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Error handling and retry logic
- Logging and monitoring

## Dependencies
Access needed to:
- `@infra-neo/local_server_poc` repository
- POC configuration files
- Existing backend API documentation

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1 (Cloud Connectors): 2-3 days (awaiting POC docs)
- Phase 2 (Headscale): 1-2 days
- Phase 3 (Authentik/LDAP): 2-3 days
- Phase 4 (Remotely/Websoft9): 2-3 days
- Phase 5 (Dashboard): 1-2 days

Total: ~2 weeks for full implementation

## Notes
- Frontend is already well-structured for these integrations
- Main blocker is access to POC repository documentation
- Can proceed with mock implementations for testing UI flows
- Production deployment requires proper backend infrastructure
